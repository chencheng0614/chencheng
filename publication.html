		<h4 class="pub"> Differentiating problematic from habitual Instagram use: A Uses & Grats 2.0 perspective</h4>
		<h5 class="authors"> Cheng Chen, Olivia Cohen, & S. Shyam Sundar </h5>
		<h6> Social Media + Society  </h6>
		<p class="abstract">The popularity of Instagram among young adults has raised concerns about the excessive use of Instagram. Is it the kind of problematic media use that takes over one’s life or just habitual ritualized use characterized by mindless scrolling? How can we differentiate between the two based on the use of Instagram features and perceived gratifications from the technology itself?

		<h4 class="pub"> Do you feel special when an AI doctor remembers you? Individuation effects of AI vs. human doctor on user experience</h4>
		<h5 class="authors">Jin Chen, Cheng Chen, Joseph B. Walther, & S. Shyam Sundar </h5>
		<h6>Extended Abstracts of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems </h6> 
		<p class="abstract">You may feel special and believe that you are getting personalized care when your doctor remembers your name and your unique medical history. 
			But, what if it is an AI doctor and not human? 
			Since AI systems are driven by personalization algorithms, it is possible to design AI doctors that can individuate patients with great precision. 
			Is this appreciated or perceived as eerie and intrusive, thereby negatively afecting doctor-patient interaction?
